**Rationale**

Not all directories in your root folder need to visible. Not all directories in your root folder need to show up in search results.

On my current project I have excluded these folders: `.idea`, `coverage`, `log`, and `tmp`.

Note: you can always see all directories in the root folder by choosing the _Project_ scope.

**Mechanism**

Right click on a folder and select _Mark Directory As > Excluded_.

You can see the total effect of your exclusions go to

_Preferences > Project > Project Structure_
