The amazing multiple cursor feature pioneered by Sublime now available in RubyMine.

Command        | Effect
:------        | :-----
ctrl+g         | works with a text selection (or without a selection on word boundaries surrounding the cursor)
shift+ctrl+g   | _go backwards_ through the selected text
command+ctrl+g | acts like ctrl+g for all matching text in the current file

Tip: select extra punctuation characters (like a dot or parentheses) to avoid partial matches.
