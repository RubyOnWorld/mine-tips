Disable Unnecessary Plugins
=====

Consider disabling the following plugins:

1. **Ruby Database Support Integration:** This plugin auto-discovers your database connections from _database.yml_ and automatically makes RubyMine datasources (see the Database tab) for you. However, it spits out annoying messages about your RubyMine datasources not found (including parameterized datasources) every time you launch the IDE.
