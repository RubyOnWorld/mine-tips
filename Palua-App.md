**Rationale**

RubyMine uses function keys to map commands.
Out of the box OS X uses function keys to perform various useful tasks.
To use function keys in RubyMine you have to also hold down the ```Fn``` button.

The Palua App lets function keys be invoked without holding the function key down when RubyMine is active while leaving the default behaviour intact everywhere else.
 
**Mechanism**

Download and install the [Palua App](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/palua/id431494195) from the App Store.
This is a paid app (less than $2 last time I checked). Well worth that price to me.

Configure Palua preferences so that:

1. Palua starts at login
1. Smart Mode is enabled
1. RubyMine is configured for function keys
