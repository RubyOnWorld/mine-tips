**Rationale**

A complex project has many files that you do not need to see in your day-to-day work. Define a scope that shows only those files that you use everyday.

On my current project I have excluded these files from the project folder: .gitignore, .rake_tasks, .rubocop.yml, .ruby-version, config.ru, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, and Rakefile.

Note: you can always see all directories and files in the root folder by choosing the Project scope.
