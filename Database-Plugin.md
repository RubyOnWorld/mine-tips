**Rationale**

I want to view the contents of my local or remote database from within RubyMine.

**Mechanism**

RubyMine supports [Database Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/2016.1/database-tool-window.html) for exactly this purpose.

Navigate to: _Preferences > Plugins_

Enable the _Database Tools and Sql_ plugin.
