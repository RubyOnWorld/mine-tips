**Rationale**

We want RubyMine to be as fast as possible.
There are a number of improvements that can make a big difference to the out of the box experience.

**Mechanism**

1. Increase Memory
1. Don't index all project directories
1. Disable plugins that you aren't going to use
1. Use the experimental build that uses the JetBrains JVM
